### Neural Network 
writing code for forward and backward propagation of neural network using NumPy
The model has been tested on digit recognition data. By training on 10,000 images the prediction accuracy is around 89%.
To achieve this accuracy the batch size should be small (around 10 to 20). 

| Activation function | Sigmoid |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Loss function | Least mean squares(LMS) |

The `predict` function uses sigmoid activations to predict the labels for the given data.
